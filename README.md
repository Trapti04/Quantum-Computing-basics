# Quantum-Computing-basics
CERN Quantum computing learning for Machine learning

https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/ for cloud computing exerience.Free online access to quantum simulators (up to 32 qubits)and actual quantum computers (1, 5 and 15 qubits) with
different topologies

notes from first session: We cannot prove mathematically that quantum computers are better. We will introduce the tools, concepts and techniques.to try out. Quantum computing about computation. You need to understand the algorithm by good understanding of

superposition, inference, entanglement are basic concepts we need to understtnad.
Quantum computing is a computing paradigm that exploits quantum mechanical properties (superposition, entanglement, interference...) of matter in order to do calculations
Quantum computer is not faster it is doing calculation in different. There are diferent models.
